### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**OOP** is a programming paradigm that structures code around objects, which represent real-world entities. In Swift, a versatile programming language, **OOP** is a fundamental approach to building software.

Key Principles of **OOP**:

- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes (subclasses) based on existing classes (superclasses), inheriting their attributes and behaviors. It promotes code reuse and hierarchy.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit (object), which hides internal details and provides a clear interface.
- **Polymorphism**: Using a single interface to represent different types of objects, enabling flexible and interchangeable components.
Abstraction: Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes to focus on essential attributes and behaviors, while hiding unnecessary details.
