## Continuous integration

**Continuous integration (CI)** is a software development methodology that involves regularly integrating code written by different developers into a common repository. This helps identify and resolve conflicts and errors at an early stage of development.

## Continuous delivery/deployment

**Continuous delivery/deployment (CD)** is an approach where each successful code modification is automatically prepared for deployment to a production environment. It's important to note that Continuous Deployment (CDep) and Continuous Delivery (CDel) share similarities, but in the case of Continuous Delivery, there is typically a manual approval step before the code is released into the production environment. In the CD process, every code change undergoes the phases of building, testing, and is subsequently deployed to a non-production testing or staging environment.

Differences:
- CI focuses on regular code integration and testing.
- CDel focuses on preparing changes for release but leaves the decision to release to developers.
- CDep focuses on automatically deploying code to the production environment without developer involvement.

Purposes:
- CI/CD helps speed up and simplify the development process, improve code quality, reduce risks, and ensure rapid and reliable software releases.

## Vocabulary:
- **Job** is a unit of execution within the CI/CD process. It can be a task performed on a server, such as code compilation, running tests, or creating artifacts.
- **Stage** is a set of related tasks (Jobs) that are executed sequentially or in parallel. Stages typically represent phases in the CI/CD process, such as build, test, and deployment.
- **Pipeline** is a collection of interconnected stages (Stages) that define the end-to-end automation process. The pipeline manages the execution of all the stages and tasks required for delivering an application.
- **Artifacts** are files created during CI/CD job execution that can be saved and used in subsequent stages. These could be binary application files or test reports.
- **Scheduler** is a component of the CI/CD system that manages the execution of tasks and stages in a specified order and schedule.

## Some examples of CI/CD/CDep for iOS developers:

- **TestFlight:**
    - Continuous Deployment: Apple's TestFlight is used for distributing iOS apps to internal and external testers before App Store release. You can automate the upload and distribution process using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Fastlane, or Bitrise.

- **Xcode Cloud**
    - Xcode Cloud is a (relatively new) continuous integration and delivery service built into Xcode and designed expressly for Apple developers. It accelerates the development and delivery of high-quality apps by bringing together cloud-based tools that help you build apps, run automated tests in parallel, deliver apps to testers, and view and manage user feedback.

- **Xcode Server:**
    - Continuous Integration: Xcode Server is Apple's (old) CI tool for macOS and iOS development. It integrates with Xcode, and you can set up bots for continuous integration, automated testing, and report generation.
    - Continuous Deployment: It can be combined with other tools to automate app deployment, such as Fastlane or custom scripts.

- **Fastlane:**
    - Continuous Deployment: Fastlane is a popular tool specifically designed for iOS and Android app deployment. It can automate the entire process of code signing, building, testing, and releasing your app. https://fastlane.tools

- **GitLab CI/CD:**
    - Continuous Integration: GitLab CI/CD provides native CI/CD capabilities and allows for the integration of macOS runners to build and test iOS apps.
    - Continuous Deployment: You can configure GitLab CI/CD to automate deployments to various distribution platforms.

- **Bitrise:**
    - Continuous Integration: Bitrise offers a cloud-based CI/CD service for iOS development, with pre-configured iOS workflows that make it easy to set up and run automated builds and tests.
    - Continuous Deployment: It can also handle app deployment to beta testing platforms like TestFlight and App Store Connect. https://bitrise.io

These tools and practices help iOS developers streamline their development processes, ensure code quality, and automate the deployment of apps to various testing and production environments. They play a crucial role in modern iOS app development, especially when working on projects with multiple team members and frequent code updates.

## Configuring CI/CD/CDep for iOS development

It involves a series of steps to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Here's a general guideline for setting up CI/CD/CDep for iOS development:

1. **Version Control System (VCS):**
    - Start by using a version control system like Git to manage your iOS project's source code. Host your code repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
1. **Select a CI/CD/CDep Tool:**
    - Choose a CI/CD/CDep tool that supports macOS for iOS development. Popular options include Fastlane, Bitrise, and GitLab CI/CD.
1. **Setting Up Your CI/CD Environment:**
    - Install the CI/CD Tool:
        Install and configure the selected CI/CD tool on a macOS build machine or a cloud-based macOS environment. Ensure it has access to your code repository.
    - Configure Build Environment:
        Set up the macOS environment with the necessary dependencies, including Xcode, CocoaPods, Carthage, or any other dependencies specific to your project.
1. **Configure CI Pipeline:**
    - Continuous Integration (CI):
        - Configure your CI pipeline to trigger a build, which includes compiling your iOS app, running unit tests, and generating build artifacts.
        - Set up a webhook or integration with your VCS to automatically initiate CI builds on code changes.
    - Automated Testing:
        - Integrate your CI pipeline with testing frameworks like XCTest or third-party testing tools. Ensure automated tests are executed as part of the CI process.
    - Code Signing:
        - Set up code signing for your iOS app within the CI pipeline. Securely manage signing certificates and provisioning profiles.
1. **Continuous Deployment (CDep):**
    - Automate Distribution:
        Use tools like Fastlane to automate the process of code signing and distributing your iOS app to beta testing platforms such as TestFlight.
    - Publish to App Store Connect:
        Configure the CI/CD pipeline to publish your app to App Store Connect when ready for production release.
    - Deployment to Staging Servers:
        Set up deployment to staging servers or environments to perform additional testing or validation before the production release.
1. **Monitoring and Notifications:**
    - Implement monitoring and notification systems to alert the team in case of build or deployment failures. Tools like Slack, email, or custom scripts can be used for notifications.
1. **Security and Permissions:**
    - Ensure proper access controls and permissions for your CI/CD environment to protect sensitive data such as code signing certificates.
1. **Logging and Reporting:**
    - Configure logging and reporting to track the progress of builds, tests, and deployments. This is important for debugging issues and tracking the history of releases.
1. **Automated Rollback:**
    - Implement a rollback strategy in case of issues in production deployments. This can involve automating the rollback process or having manual procedures in place.
1. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Regularly review and optimize your CI/CD/CDep processes. Analyze build and deployment times, test coverage, and overall pipeline efficiency.
1. **Documentation:**
    - Maintain documentation for your CI/CD/CDep setup, including configuration, deployment instructions, and troubleshooting guides.
1. **Security Scanning:**
    - Integrate security scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in your iOS app.

By following these steps, you can establish a robust CI/CD/CDep process for iOS development, ensuring that your app is built, tested, and deployed with efficiency, reliability, and security.
