### Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP)

**Protocol-Oriented Programming** is an approach that emphasizes defining protocols (interfaces) to describe shared behaviors and structures. Instead of relying solely on class inheritance, it promotes composing objects through protocol adoption, fostering code reusability and flexibility.

Key Aspects:

- **Protocols**: Define contracts for methods and properties that types must conform to.
- **Composition**: Combine smaller protocols to create complex behaviors by adopting multiple protocols.
- **Value Types**: Encourage creating value types (structs, enums) over classes for better safety and performance.
- **Default Implementations**: Provide default method implementations within protocols for shared functionality.

Benefits:
- Improved modularity and flexibility.
- Clearer and more focused code with smaller protocols.
- Reduced tight coupling, allowing diverse types to interact.
- Easier testing and more efficient memory management.

***Note***: *POP complements Object-Oriented Programming and can be particularly effective in Swift due to its focus on value types and protocol extensions.*
