#### SOLID Principles

**Single Responsbility Principle (SRP)**
- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

*Bad examples: Apple MVC, AppDelegate...*

**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
- ï»¿Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
